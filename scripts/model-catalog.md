# Model catalog refresh

The committed FrogBot and gateway model catalogs are generated from the current
`https://models.dev/api.json` dataset by a maintainer. Application startup and
user type generation never fetch model metadata.

`pnpm bump` runs `pnpm sync:catalog` first, so every release ships a fresh
catalog and its build and tests run against it. To refresh between releases, run
`pnpm sync:catalog` directly. Either way, review the provider and model changes
and commit these artifacts together:

- `packages/frogbot/src/ai/catalog.json`
- `packages/frogbot/src/ai/generated.ts`
- `packages/gateway/src/providers/catalog.data.ts`

`scripts/sync-catalog.mjs` contains the pinned field transformations and provider
aliases. Models marked `deprecated` by models.dev are excluded. The provider-keyed
`add` and `exclude` corrections in `scripts/model-catalog-overlays.json` supplement
or remove reviewed source entries. Voyage uses this mechanism because models.dev
does not currently provide it. Replicate is reserved as an overlay-only provider
but has no catalog entries until reviewed metadata is available.

The generated files are sorted by model ID. A second `pnpm sync:catalog` against
the same source data must leave the worktree unchanged.
